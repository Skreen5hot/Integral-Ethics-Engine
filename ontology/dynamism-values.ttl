# DYNAMISM WORLDVIEW VALUE ONTOLOGY

#
# Worldview: Dynamism (Process Philosophy)
# Foundation: Becoming - Reality is fundamentally dynamic, not static
# Primacy: Change, growth, transformation, vital energy
# Epistemology: Developmental observation, process tracking
# Cluster: Process-Individual
#
# Key Thinkers:
# - Heraclitus (535-475 BCE): "Panta rhei" - everything flows
# - Henri Bergson (1859-1941): Creative evolution, élan vital
# - Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947): Process and Reality
# - Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995): Difference and repetition, becoming
