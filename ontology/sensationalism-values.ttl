# Sensationalism Worldview - Value Hierarchy
# ============================================================================
#
# Philosophical Foundation:
# - Reality is fundamentally qualitative sensory experience
# - Knowledge derives from immediate felt qualities (qualia)
# - Epistemology: Direct sensory intuition, phenomenal immediacy
# - Values grounded in experiential richness and aesthetic beauty
#
# Primary Sources:
# - Hume, D. (1739-40). A Treatise of Human Nature. Oxford University Press.
# - Berkeley, G. (1710). A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge.

#
# Key Distinction from Materialism:
# - Materialism: Physical substrate is real, experience is derivative
# - Sensationalism: Experience/sensation is real, physical substrate inferred
#
# Key Distinction from Phenomenalism:
# - Phenomenalism: Focuses on validity of appearances (epistemic)
# - Sensationalism: Focuses on quality of sensations (axiological)
#
# Key Distinction from Rationalism:
# - Rationalism: Abstract logical relations are fundamental
# - Sensationalism: Immediate sensory impressions are fundamental
#   (Hume's distinction: impressions have greater vivacity than ideas)
#
# This ontology uses BFO/CCO patterns and integrates with ValueNet to
# model how sensationalist metaphysics grounds specific value hierarchies
# and maps to value dispositions.
