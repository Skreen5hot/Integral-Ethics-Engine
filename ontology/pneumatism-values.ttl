Pneumatism grounds value in living spirit (pneuma, breath, life-force) that
pervades and animates nature. Reality is fundamentally alive - cosmos is ensouled,
not composed of dead matter mechanically interacting. Spirit is immanent in nature,
not transcendent or separate.

Metaphysical Foundation:
- Pneuma (spirit/breath/life-force) as fundamental reality
- Cosmos as living organism, not dead mechanism
- Anima mundi (world-soul) pervading all things
- Nature as sacred, animate, spiritually alive
- Vital force (élan vital) driving evolution and growth

Epistemology:
- Knowledge through participation in spiritual ecology
- Ritual as mode of communion with spirit in nature
- Shamanic vision, ecstatic experience, spirit encounter
- Indigenous knowledge systems, oral tradition
- Feeling/sensing spirit presence in natural world

Value Priority:
- Spiritual vitality (living energy, life-force)
- Ensouled cosmos (world as sacred living being)
- Immanent divinity (divine present in nature, not remote)
- Sacred presence (awareness of spiritual dimension in immediate environment)
- Ecological reciprocity (humans as part of animate nature)

Worldview Cluster: Depth-Spiritual (Spirit foundation + Immanent depth)

Key Philosophers and Traditions:
- Henri Bergson: Élan vital, creative evolution, duration
- F.W.J. Schelling: Naturphilosophie, living nature, absolute idealism
- Alfred North Whitehead: Process philosophy, organic mechanism
- Baruch Spinoza: Deus sive Natura (God or Nature), immanent divinity
- Giordano Bruno: Infinite universe, world-soul, panpsychism
- Thales, Anaximander: Pre-Socratic hylozoism (matter is alive)
- Animism: Tylor, Hallowell, Bird-David, Harvey
- Indigenous philosophies: Native American, Aboriginal, African traditional
- Shamanism: Eliade, Harner, Vitebsky
- Deep Ecology: Arne Naess, Joanna Macy
- Gaia Hypothesis: James Lovelock, Lynn Margulis
- Vitalism: Hans Driesch, Henri Bergson

Empirical Grounding:
- Gaia hypothesis: Earth as self-regulating living system
- Biophilia hypothesis: Innate human affinity for life
- Ecological psychology: Affordances, organism-environment mutuality
- Systems theory: Holistic organization, emergent properties
- Indigenous ecological knowledge: Sustainable practices, biodiversity

Vitalism vs Mechanism: Vitalism holds life cannot be explained by physics/chemistry alone -
requires vital force or organizing principle. Rejected by modern biology as scientifically
unnecessary, but phenomenologically significant - living systems exhibit properties (purpose,
self-organization, reproduction) qualitatively different from non-living.

Cross-Cultural Concepts:

- Chi/Qi (Chinese): Life energy circulating through meridians
- Prana (Sanskrit): Vital breath, life force in yoga/Ayurveda
- Orenda (Iroquois): Spiritual force in all things
- Mana (Polynesian): Spiritual power/energy

Empirical Correlates: While vitalism per se is rejected, living systems do exhibit emergent
properties - autopoiesis (self-production), far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics, complex
adaptive systems. Systems biology studies holistic organization.

Shamanism: Eliade defines shaman as "technician of ecstasy" - practitioner who journeys to
spirit worlds in altered states (trance, drumming, entheogens). Universal patterns: initiatory
crisis, dismemberment/death/rebirth, animal helpers, world tree/axis mundi. Shaman mediates
between human and spirit worlds.

Ritual Efficacy: Rituals are performative, not merely symbolic. Saying/doing makes it so
(Austin's performatives). Ritual creates sacred time and space, transforms participants,
maintains cosmic order. Roy Rappaport: ritual establishes convention, enacts commitment,
constitutes sacred.

Rites of Passage: Van Gennep - rituals marking life transitions (birth, puberty, marriage,
death). Three phases: separation, liminality (threshold), reincorporation. Victor Turner:
liminality as anti-structure, communitas, transformation. Ritual death and rebirth literally
experienced.

Participatory Knowing: Rituals provide knowledge unavailable to detached observation. Must
participate to understand. Initiation conveys gnosis (experiential knowing), not just doctrine.
Shamanic journeys reveal spirit geography, plant knowledge, healing techniques.

Critique of Functionalism: Functionalist anthropology (Durkheim, Malinowski) reduces ritual
to social function - solidarity, anxiety reduction. Pneumatism: rituals genuinely contact
spiritual realities, not merely express social structure. Phenomenology takes participant
perspective seriously.

- Spirit Journey: Traveling to non-ordinary reality via tunnel, flight, descent
- Power Animals: Spirit helpers in animal form, sources of power and guidance
- Soul Retrieval: Recovering fragmented soul parts lost through trauma
- Extraction: Removing spiritual intrusions causing illness
- Divination: Consulting spirits for guidance, hidden knowledge

Vision Quest: Indigenous North American practice - fasting, isolation in wilderness, seeking
vision from spirit world. Rite of passage providing spiritual name, life direction, power.
Contemporary practice adapted by non-indigenous seekers.

Altered States: Shamanic consciousness (SSC - shamanic state of consciousness) distinct from
ordinary waking. Induced by drumming, dancing, fasting, entheogens (ayahuasca, peyote, psilocybin),
breathwork. Trance allows perception of spirit dimension.

Empirical Research: Anthropology documents universality of shamanic patterns across cultures.
Neuropsychology studies trance states - EEG changes, theta rhythms, hallucinations. Efficacy
research on shamanic healing shows positive outcomes (placebo-controlled studies difficult).

Cultural Appropriation Concerns: Non-indigenous adoption of shamanic practices raises ethical
issues - commodification, decontextualization, exploitation. Respectful engagement requires
humility, permission, reciprocity with indigenous communities.

BFO Modeling: Shamanic practice is extended Process (bfo:0000015) involving trance induction,
spirit journey, and return. Encounters spirit-beings (agents in spirit realm), retrieves
information or power (ICE - bfo:0000031).

seasonal festivals, rites of passage, offerings to spirits, purification rituals, sacred dances.

Functions of Ritual:
- Cosmological: Maintaining cosmic order, renewing world (Eliade's illud tempus)
- Social: Creating solidarity, marking transitions, resolving conflicts
- Psychological: Managing anxiety, facilitating transformation, inducing ecstasy
- Spiritual: Communing with spirits, honoring deities, receiving blessings

Seasonal Rituals: Agricultural societies celebrate seasonal cycles - planting, harvest, solstices,
equinoxes. Rituals align human community with natural rhythms. Example: Spring planting ceremonies
asking blessing from earth/corn spirits. Autumn harvest festivals offering gratitude.

Rites of Passage: Birth, puberty, marriage, death marked by rituals. Van Gennep's structure:
separation (leaving old status), liminality (threshold/transition), incorporation (new status).
Initiations transform identity - boy becomes man, maiden becomes woman, living becomes ancestor.

Offerings and Sacrifice: Gifts to spirits - food, drink, tobacco, objects. Sacrifice (making
sacred) through giving. Reciprocity with spirit world. Potlatch (Pacific Northwest): ceremonial
giving demonstrating wealth and status, redistributing resources.

Performative Ritual: Roy Rappaport - rituals establish convention, display acceptance, enact
commitment. Saying "I do" in wedding creates marriage. Ritual is performative utterance
(Austin), not merely expressive.

BFO Modeling: Rituals are temporally extended Processes (bfo:0000015) with participants,
locations, and outcomes. Create sacred ICE (bfo:0000031) - sacred time and space distinct

    rdfs:comment """Ecological reciprocity is practice of mutual exchange with natural world -
offering gifts to plant/animal spirits, expressing gratitude for harvests, taking only what
is needed, giving back. Not one-directional extraction but circular relationship.

Gift Economy: Marcel Mauss - gifts create obligations, social bonds. Three obligations: give,
receive, return. Gift economies contrast with commodity markets - gifts circulate, create
relationships, carry spirit of giver (hau in Maori). Kimmerer: relationship with Earth as
gift economy, not property/commodity.

Honorable Harvest: Indigenous principles for sustainable harvesting (Kimmerer):
- Ask permission, listen for answer
- Take only what you need, leave some for others
- Never take first or last plant
- Harvest in way that minimizes harm
- Use everything you take
- Share what you have
- Give thanks, give gifts
- Reciprocate the gift
- Sustain the ones who sustain you

Prayers and Offerings: Hunters offer prayers/tobacco to animal spirits before hunt. Gatherers
ask permission from plant spirits. Fishers offer first fish back to water. These practices
acknowledge agency of other-than-human beings, maintain reciprocal relationship, prevent
over-exploitation.

Empirical Support: Indigenous resource management sustains ecosystems for millennia - salmon
fisheries (Pacific Northwest), buffalo management (Plains), forest gardens (Amazon). Spiritual
reciprocity correlates with sustainable practices. Contrast with industrial extraction causing
ecosystem collapse.

Contrast with Modern Extractivism: Capitalism treats nature as resource pool for extraction,
not partner in relationship. Unlimited taking without giving back. Ecological crisis stems
from broken reciprocity - one-way flow from nature to humans.

BFO Modeling: Reciprocity is realized in cyclical Processes (bfo:0000015) of giving-receiving
between humans and natural beings. Gifts are material entities transferred with spiritual

Numinous Experience: Rudolf Otto - encounter with the holy (das Heilige) as mysterium
tremendum et fascinans. Overwhelming mystery, dread (tremendum), fascination (fascinans).
Creature-feeling - sense of dependence before ultimate power. Cannot be reduced to ethics or
rationality.

Hierophany: Mircea Eliade - manifestation of sacred in profane world. Sacred breaks through
ordinary reality - burning bush, sacred mountain, world tree. Sacred space: axis mundi (center
of world), oriented to transcendent. Sacred time: illud tempus (primordial time of origins).

William James: Mystical experience has four marks - ineffability, noetic quality (conviction
of truth), transiency, passivity. "Something not ourselves" is experienced. Varieties include
nature mysticism, theistic visions, monistic absorption.

Types of Spirit Encounter:
- Nature Spirits: Dryads in trees, naiads in springs, mountain kami, river spirits
- Animal Helpers: Power animals in shamanic practice (bear, eagle, snake)
- Ancestors: Deceased relatives continuing presence, guidance
- Deities: Gods/goddesses of particular places, functions
- Angels/Demons: Intermediary spirits between divine and human

    rdfs:label "Ecological Crisis Scenario"@en ;
    skos:description """
**Scenario**: A corporation plans to clear-cut old-growth forest for timber profit. Environmental
impact statement shows species habitat loss, water pollution, carbon release. Indigenous
community opposes, citing sacred mountain, ancestral spirits dwelling in forest.

**Pneumatism Interpretation**:
Not merely resource management issue but spiritual violation. Forest is ensouled, sacred -
home to spirits, ancestors, living beings with intrinsic value. Clear-cutting is sacrilege,
violence against living cosmos, breaking reciprocal relationship with nature.

**Value Analysis**:
- **Terminal Value Violated**: EnsouledCosmos (treating living forest as dead commodity),
  ImmanentDivinity (destroying sacred presence), SacredPresence (eliminating spiritual habitat)
- **Constitutive Value Violated**: AnimateNature (denying forest's aliveness), SpiritualEcology
  (breaking reciprocity), SacredAwareness (ignoring spiritual dimension)
- **Instrumental Response**: RitualCeremony (ceremonies honoring forest spirits, asking guidance),
  EcologicalReciprocity (if harvest needed, take minimally with offerings and gratitude),
  SpiritEncounter (seeking vision/guidance from forest spirits)

**Pneumatism Recommendation**: Oppose clear-cutting. If any harvest necessary, selective logging
with ritual protocols - prayers to tree spirits, offerings, gratitude, replanting. Protect
sacred groves entirely. Recognize indigenous sovereignty over ancestral lands. Economic value
subordinate to spiritual and ecological value.

**Contrast with Other Worldviews**:
- Materialism: Cost-benefit analysis - timber profit vs habitat loss (purely material calculation)
- Rationalism: Kantian duty - respect for nature as rational system, sustainable use principles
- Psychism: Forest as symbol of unconscious, collective psyche - psychological significance
- Spiritualism (transcendent): God's creation to steward, not exploit - dominion with care

**Pneumatism Unique Contribution**: Recognizes forest as living spiritual community of beings
(trees, animals, spirits, ancestors). Relationship with forest is I-Thou, not I-It. Reciprocity,
not domination. Sacred presence in nature itself, not mediated through transcendent deity.

:HealingRitualScenario a :Scenario ;

    skos:description """
**Scenario**: Person suffers chronic illness unresponsive to medical treatment. Shaman diagnoses
spiritual cause - soul-loss from trauma, intrusion by harmful spirit. Recommends healing
ceremony involving drumming, soul retrieval, extraction, community support.

**Pneumatism Interpretation**:
Illness has spiritual dimension, not merely physical pathology. Soul fragmentation and spiritual
intrusion cause physical symptoms. Healing requires addressing spiritual root, not just treating
symptoms. Shaman as mediator between human and spirit worlds.

**Value Analysis**:
- **Terminal Value Pursued**: SpiritualVitality (restoring life-force, wholeness), SacredPresence
  (reconnecting with spiritual dimension)
- **Constitutive Value Engaged**: RitualParticipation (ceremony as genuine spirit contact),
  SacredAwareness (sensing spirit helpers and intrusions)
- **Instrumental Action**: ShamanicPractice (journeying to retrieve soul parts, extract intrusions),
  RitualCeremony (community ceremony supporting healing), SpiritEncounter (working with power
  animals and helping spirits)

**Pneumatism Healing Process**:
1. Diagnostic journey - shaman enters trance, journeys to spirit world, diagnoses spiritual causes
2. Soul retrieval - shaman travels to where soul parts are stuck (past trauma), retrieves them,
   returns them to patient
3. Extraction - shaman removes spiritual intrusions (harmful energies, spirits)
4. Power restoration - shaman brings back power animal or spiritual power
5. Integration - patient receives soul parts, commitments to life changes preventing re-injury
6. Community support - circle holds space, provides prayers, offers ongoing support

**Empirical Outcomes**: Shamanic healing shows efficacy in some studies - reduced symptoms,
improved well-being, psychological transformation. Mechanisms may include: meaning-making,
social support, placebo/expectancy, altered states accessing self-healing capacities.

**Contrast with Other Worldviews**:
- Materialism: Illness is biological pathology, treat with medicine/surgery (spiritual dimension
  denied or dismissed as placebo)
- Psychism: Illness reflects psychological conflicts, use psychotherapy (symbolic/archetypal
  interpretation, not literal spirits)
- Rationalism: Psychosomatic illness - mind affects body through known mechanisms (stress,
  immune system), rational explanation without spirits
- Spiritualism (transcendent): Pray to transcendent God for healing, faith healing (vertical
  relationship with deity, not horizontal with nature spirits)

**Pneumatism Unique Contribution**: Takes spirit-world literally, not symbolically. Shaman
genuinely encounters spirits, retrieves soul parts. Not psychological metaphor but ontological
reality. Healing through restoring right relationship with spiritual ecology.

    skos:description """
**Scenario**: Young person at life transition (graduation, career crossroads) seeks direction.
Undertakes vision quest - 4 days fasting alone in wilderness, praying for vision from spirits.
Receives encounter with eagle spirit offering guidance and power.

**Pneumatism Interpretation**:
Vision quest is genuine spiritual initiation, not merely psychological exercise. Fasting, isolation,
and prayer create conditions for spirit contact. Eagle spirit is real being offering teaching,
not projection of unconscious. Vision provides authentic guidance for life path.

**Value Analysis**:
- **Terminal Value Realized**: SacredPresence (direct encounter with spirit in wilderness),
  SpiritualVitality (receiving power from eagle spirit), ImmanentDivinity (divine guidance
  through nature spirit)
- **Constitutive Value Engaged**: AnimateNature (wilderness as alive, communicative), Sacred
  Awareness (perceiving spirit presence), RitualParticipation (vision quest as ritual initiation)
- **Instrumental Practice**: SpiritEncounter (meeting eagle spirit), ShamanicPractice (fasting,
  prayer, vision-seeking), RitualCeremony (departure and return ceremonies, integration with
  community)

**Vision Quest Process**:
1. Preparation - fasting, purification, setting intention, receiving instructions from elder
2. Departure ceremony - community sends quester off with prayers, sage blessing
3. Isolation - 4 days alone in wilderness, no food/water, constant prayer, awaiting vision
4. Spirit encounter - eagle appears in vision/dream, offers teaching, may give name or power
5. Return - quester returns to community, shares vision with elder
6. Integration - living vision's teaching, incorporating eagle power into daily life

**Vision Content Examples**:
- Eagle teaches to see from high perspective, not get caught in details
- Eagle offers name "Soaring Spirit" representing life purpose
- Eagle shows future path - becoming teacher, healer, protector
- Eagle gives power - courage to take risks, trust in spiritual support

**Empirical Understanding**: Psychology: vision quest facilitates identity development,
meaning-making, psychological transformation. Wilderness solo reduces external stimulation,
heightens introspection, can induce hallucinations. Ritual structure provides safe container
for transformation.

**Contrast with Other Worldviews**:
- Materialism: Hallucinations from fasting/isolation, no objective reality (brain chemistry,
  not spirits)
- Psychism: Vision as archetypal encounter from collective unconscious, not literal spirit
  (eagle as symbol of transcendence, not actual being)
- Rationalism: Vision as product of rational reflection, isolated from social noise (clarity
  of reason, not supernatural contact)
- Spiritualism (transcendent): Vision as answer to prayer from transcendent God, not nature
  spirit (vertical divine-human relationship)

**Pneumatism Unique Contribution**: Eagle spirit is real autonomous being, not symbol or
hallucination. Nature is sacred medium for divine encounter. Spirit guidance comes through
immanent presence in wilderness, not transcendent intervention. Reciprocal relationship with
eagle spirit ongoing, not one-time message.
