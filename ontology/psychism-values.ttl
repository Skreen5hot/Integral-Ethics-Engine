Psychism grounds value in soul depth, psychological wholeness, and the reality
of the unconscious. Reality is fundamentally psychic - soul/psyche is the
foundation from which consciousness emerges. The unconscious is not merely
absence of consciousness but a positive realm of archetypal structures, symbols,
and autonomous psychic forces.

Metaphysical Foundation:
- Soul/psyche as fundamental reality (not reducible to brain/matter)
- Unconscious as primary; consciousness is derivative or surface phenomenon
- Archetypal structures as transpersonal organizing principles
- Psychic reality has its own laws, causality, and teleology
- Symbolic/imaginal realm as ontologically real

Epistemology:
- Knowledge through psychological introspection, dream work, active imagination
- Symbol as primary mode of knowing (not reducible to concept)
- Amplification, association, and archetypal interpretation
- Personal unconscious and collective unconscious differentiated
- Psychic truth vs literal/empirical truth

Value Priority:
- Psychological wholeness (integration of conscious and unconscious)
- Emotional authenticity (genuine feeling vs persona)
- Soul depth (engagement with archetypal structures)
- Individuation process (becoming one's unique self)
- Shadow integration (acknowledging repressed aspects)

Worldview Cluster: Depth-Spiritual (Soul/Psyche foundation + Depth dimension)

Key Philosophers:
- Carl Jung: Analytical psychology, archetypes, individuation
- Sigmund Freud: Psychoanalysis, unconscious, depth psychology
- James Hillman: Archetypal psychology, soul-making
- Marie-Louise von Franz: Jungian psychology, fairy tales
- Edward Edinger: Ego and archetype
- Marion Woodman: Body and soul, feminine psychology
- Robert Johnson: Shadow work, inner work
- Erich Neumann: Depth psychology, origins of consciousness

Empirical Grounding:
- Empirical research on Jungian therapy effectiveness
- Neuroscience of unconscious processing
- Attachment theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth)
- Personality psychology (Big Five, depth approaches)
- Dream research and symbolism studies

behavioral health or cognitive clarity, wholeness refers to the integration of opposites within
the psyche - conscious/unconscious, light/shadow, masculine/feminine, rational/irrational.

Jung distinguishes wholeness from perfection: perfection implies flawlessness and exclusion
of the negative; wholeness embraces totality including the shadow. The Self (capital S) is
the archetype of wholeness - the totality of conscious and unconscious.

Individuation Process: The lifelong process of becoming one's unique self, differentiating
from collective norms while integrating unconscious contents. Not self-actualization
(humanistic psychology) but Self-realization (archetypal psychology).

Empirical Correlates: Well-being, life satisfaction, meaning in life, psychological flexibility.
However, Psychism subordinates happiness to wholeness - individuation may involve suffering,
confrontation with the shadow, and dissolution of comfortable illusions.

BFO Modeling: Psychological wholeness is a Quality (bfo:0000019) that inheres in the psyche,
realized through individuation Processes (bfo:0000015). The degree of wholeness varies along
a continuum from fragmentation (neurosis) to integration (individuation).

Authentic feeling is discriminating - knows what it values - but not reducible to preference

Shadow of Authenticity: Not all genuine feelings should be expressed (ethical boundaries).
Authenticity can become narcissistic self-indulgence if not balanced with relational
responsibility. Psychism values inner authenticity but recognizes outer persona has adaptive

Emotional Labor: Hochschild's (1983) concept of emotional labor (managing feelings for work)

Personal Shadow: Repressed aspects of personal history - forbidden desires, shameful memories,
rejected traits. Often projected onto others (what we hate in others reveals our shadow).

Collective Shadow: Cultural repressions - what society deems unacceptable. Different cultures

cultures).

Shadow as Gold: Shadow is not only "dark" - it contains repressed creativity, vitality, power.
The "inferior function" (Jung) is often in shadow - undeveloped but containing growth potential.

Integration not Expression: Shadow work is not acting out every impulse but acknowledging
shadow's reality, withdrawing projections, and integrating energy consciously. Ethical
boundaries remain.

Projection: Shadow is often encountered through projection - seeing in others what we deny
in ourselves. Strong emotional reactions (fascination or repulsion) indicate projection.

Not Moral Judgment: Psychic honesty does not judge psychic contents as good or bad but
acknowledges what is. One may have murderous fantasies without acting on them. Honesty is
prerequisite for ethical choice - can only choose responsibly if aware of actual impulses.

Defense Mechanisms: Freud's defense mechanisms (repression, denial, projection, rationalization,
reaction formation) are forms of psychic dishonesty - protecting ego from unacceptable truths.
Necessary in childhood, problematic when chronic in adulthood.

Self-Deception: Psychic dishonesty is often unconscious - we genuinely believe our
rationalizations. Shadow work and analysis make unconscious deceptions conscious.

Cultural Variation: What can be honestly acknowledged varies by culture. Individualist cultures
(West) may permit acknowledgment of selfish desires; collectivist cultures (East) may require
harmonious self-presentation. Psychism values honesty but recognizes cultural shaping.

confirmation bias - ways we deceive ourselves to maintain self-esteem or worldview.

than specific technique. Common factors (empathy, alliance, positive regard) across approaches.

Limitations: Therapy is not the only path to individuation. Creative work, religious practice,
relationship, suffering can all serve individuation. Therapy is privileged in Psychism but
not exclusive.

Cultural Critique: WEIRD bias (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic). Therapy
assumes individualist values (autonomy, self-expression). Collectivist cultures may prioritize
harmony over authenticity.

BFO Modeling: Psychotherapy is an extended Process (bfo:0000015) with roles (therapist, client),
aims (insight, integration), and transformations (symptom reduction, character change).

consciousness. Myths are not primitive explanations but eternal truths about psychic reality,
expressed symbolically.

Campbell's Monomyth: Hero's journey (separation, initiation, return) as universal pattern
of psychological transformation. Found across cultures because it maps archetypal process of
ego development and individuation.

Fairy Tales: Von Franz shows fairy tales as simpler than myths, depicting single psychological
problems and their resolution. Amplification through fairy tales illuminates personal complexes.

Psychological Reading: Myths are not about external events but internal psychic processes.
Persephone's abduction is not historical event but symbolic of ego's encounter with unconscious
(underworld). Every person undergoes this "descent."

Cultural Diversity: Different cultures emphasize different archetypal patterns. Trickster
prominent in Native American mythology, Mother Goddess in ancient Mediterranean, Warrior-Hero
in Germanic myths. Psychism values cross-cultural study.

Empirical Basis: Narratives structure memory and identity (narrative psychology). Life stories
follow mythic patterns (McAdams). Archetypes as evolved psychological modules (evolutionary
psychology, though reductive).

BFO Modeling: Myths are Information Content Entities (bfo:0000031) encoding archetypal patterns.
Mythological study is a Process of interpretation connecting personal experience to universal
patterns.

    skos:description """
**Scenario**: A 45-year-old successful lawyer experiences depression, questioning life
meaning despite outward success. Dreams of being trapped in a concrete building, longing
for nature.

**Psychism Interpretation**:
Not chemical imbalance or cognitive distortion but psyche's demand for individuation. Persona
identification (lawyer role) no longer sufficient - psyche demands authentic life. Dream reveals
split: Ego identifies with constructed persona (concrete building); unconscious longs for
instinct and nature (repressed inferior function).

**Value Analysis**:
- **Terminal Value Violated**: IndividuationProcess (life lived for persona, not authentic self),
  PsychologicalWholeness (ego-shadow split), EmotionalAuthenticity (performing role, not genuine)
- **Constitutive Value Needed**: ShadowIntegration (acknowledge repressed desires), PsychicHonesty
  (admit dissatisfaction despite success), SymbolicConsciousness (read dream symbolically)
- **Instrumental Response**: DreamWork (explore recurring dream imagery), PsychotherapyPractice
  (long-term depth work), ActiveImagination (dialogue with nature figure in dream)

**Psychism Recommendation**: Not 'fix depression' (symptom focus) but use crisis as opportunity
for individuation. Second half of life requires different values than first half (Jung). Shadow
integration and life restructuring necessary. Suffering has meaning - psyche forcing growth.

**Contrast with Other Worldviews**:
- Materialism: Chemical imbalance, prescribe antidepressants (subordinates psychic meaning)
- Rationalism: Cognitive distortion, challenge irrational thoughts (ignores archetypal dimension)
- Sensationalism: Existential ennui, seek new experiences (surface novelty vs depth)
"""@en .

:RecurringNightmareScenario a :Scenario ;
    rdfs:label "Recurring Nightmare Scenario"@en ;
    skos:description """
**Scenario**: A woman has recurring nightmares of being chased by a dark male figure. Wakes
terrified. Avoids sleep, seeks medication to suppress dreams.

**Psychism Interpretation**:
Dark male figure likely represents shadow (repressed masculine qualities) or animus (unconscious
masculine aspect in woman). Pursuit indicates shadow's attempt to force recognition - what
ego rejects, unconscious pursues. Not external threat but internal psychic reality demanding
integration.

**Value Analysis**:
- **Terminal Value Threatened**: PsychologicalWholeness (ego-shadow split severe), SoulDepth
  (ego avoids depth, staying surface)
- **Constitutive Value Needed**: ShadowIntegration (confront dark figure, not flee), Symbolic
  Consciousness (see figure as symbol, not literal threat), PsychicHonesty (acknowledge what
  darkness represents - anger? sexuality? power?)
- **Instrumental Response**: DreamWork (engage nightmare through active imagination), Active
  Imagination (while awake, invite figure to speak - ask what it wants), Psychotherapy (explore
  relational patterns - where is masculine rejected in life?)

**Psychism Recommendation**: Turn and face the figure (Jung's advice for nightmare pursuit).
Active imagination: Ask "Who are you? What do you want?" Often the pursuer transforms when
confronted consciously. Shadow integration reduces nightmare intensity - not suppressing but
integrating. Dream is not problem but attempted solution - psyche trying to heal.

**Suppression Critique**: Medication suppressing dreams prevents psyche's self-healing attempt.
Symptom (nightmare) removed but underlying psychic split worsens. Psychism values: work with
dream, not against it.

**Contrast with Other Worldviews**:
- Materialism: Brain chemistry imbalance, prescribe sleep medication (suppresses psyche)
- Rationalism: Irrational fear, use exposure therapy (behaviorist, ignores meaning)
- Phenomenalism: Anxious phenomenology, mindfulness to observe without attachment (helpful but
  insufficient - doesn't engage shadow)
"""@en .

:CreativeBlockScenario a :Scenario ;
    rdfs:label "Creative Block Scenario"@en ;
    skos:description """
**Scenario**: An artist experiences creative block lasting months. Previously productive, now
stares at blank canvas. Feels empty, uninspired. Tries to force creativity through discipline
- fails.

**Psychism Interpretation**:
Creative block often signals exhaustion of current archetypal constellation. Previous work
expressed one archetypal pattern (e.g., Puer - youthful innovation); that pattern now exhausted.
Fallow period necessary for new archetypal constellation to emerge. Emptiness is not absence
but pregnant void - womb of new creation (Hillman).

**Value Analysis**:
- **Terminal Value Challenged**: IndividuationProcess (stuck in old pattern, needs transformation),
  SoulDepth (soul withdrawn, not available to ego), EmotionalAuthenticity (forcing false
  creativity)
- **Constitutive Value Needed**: SymbolicConsciousness (read emptiness symbolically - death/rebirth,
  not failure), PsychicHonesty (admit current well is dry, not pretend), ArchetypalAwareness
  (recognize archetypal transition)
- **Instrumental Response**: DreamWork (what images appear in dreams?), ActiveImagination
  (descend into emptiness, what's there?), MythologicalStudy (research myths of creative
  darkness - Inanna's descent, Christ's tomb, alchemical nigredo)

**Psychism Recommendation**: Honor the fallow period. Don't force. Descend into darkness
(depression as necessary stage - Hillman's 'depression as initiation'). Study myths of death/
rebirth. Allow old creative identity to die so new can emerge. Emptiness is alchemical nigredo
(blackening) preceding albedo (whitening) and rubedo (reddening) - necessary dissolution before
new integration.

**Forcing Critique**: Ego's attempt to control creative process violates soul's autonomy.
Creativity is gift from psyche, not ego achievement. Spiritual disciplines (fasting, silence,
solitude) may help - creating space for psyche to speak.

**Contrast with Other Worldviews**:
- Materialism: Neurochemical fatigue, rest and routine will restore function (mechanistic)
- Rationalism: Problem-solving failure, analyze block rationally (ego-control, ignores soul)
- Dynamism: Creative flow blocked, change environment or seek stimulation (surface change vs
  depth transformation)
- Spiritualism: Spiritual dryness, pray for inspiration (external divine vs internal psyche)

:EmpiricalSupport rdfs:comment """
Psychism's values have empirical support from depth psychology research, neuroscience,
personality psychology, and clinical outcomes research.

**Jungian Therapy Effectiveness**:
- Roesler, C. (2013). Evidence for the effectiveness of Jungian psychotherapy: A review of
  empirical studies. Behavioral Sciences, 3(4), 562-575.
  → Meta-analysis shows Jungian therapy effective for depression, anxiety, with effect sizes
     comparable to CBT. Long-term follow-up shows sustained benefits.

**Unconscious Processing**:
- Bargh, J. A., & Morsella, E. (2008). The unconscious mind. Perspectives on Psychological
  Science, 3(1), 73-79.
  → Extensive empirical evidence for unconscious information processing, implicit attitudes,
     automatic behaviors. Unconscious is not merely absent consciousness but active processor.

**Archetypes and Evolved Psychology**:
- Stevens, A. (2006). The archetypes. In R. K. Papadopoulos (Ed.), The Handbook of Jungian
  Psychology (pp. 74-93). Routledge.
  → Evolutionary psychology provides naturalistic account of archetypes as evolved psychological
     modules (mother attachment, predator detection, sexual selection).

**Dream Function**:
- Cartwright, R., Agargun, M. Y., Kirkby, J., & Friedman, J. K. (2006). Relation of dreams to
  waking concerns. Psychiatry Research, 141(3), 261-270.
  → Dreams reflect waking emotional concerns and contribute to emotional regulation. Supports
     compensatory function (though not full Jungian symbolism).

**Shadow Projection**:
- Pronin, E., Gilovich, T., & Ross, L. (2004). Objectivity in the eye of the beholder:
  Divergent perceptions of bias in self versus others. Psychological Review, 111(3), 781-799.
  → People readily see biases in others but not in themselves. Empirical support for projection
     mechanism - attributing one's own unacknowledged traits to others.

**Therapeutic Relationship**:
- Norcross, J. C., & Lambert, M. J. (2018). Psychotherapy relationships that work III.
  Psychotherapy, 55(4), 303-315.
  → Meta-analysis: Therapeutic alliance accounts for more outcome variance than specific
     techniques. Supports Jung/Rogers emphasis on relationship over technique.

**Personality Development**:
- Roberts, B. W., & Mroczek, D. (2008). Personality trait change in adulthood. Current
  Directions in Psychological Science, 17(1), 31-35.
  → Personality continues developing throughout adulthood, especially in midlife. Supports
     Jung's concept of midlife transformation and second half of life development.

**Attachment and Early Relationships**:
- Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and Loss, Vol. 1: Attachment. Basic Books.
- Ainsworth, M. D. S., et al. (1978). Patterns of Attachment. Erlbaum.
  → Early relational patterns shape later psychological functioning. Empirical basis for
     psychodynamic emphasis on childhood and relational templates.

**Narrative Identity**:
- McAdams, D. P. (2001). The psychology of life stories. Review of General Psychology, 5(2),
  100-122.
  → Identity is narrative construction following archetypal patterns (redemption, contamination,
     hero's journey). Life stories structure experience and meaning.

**Symbolism and Metaphor**:
- Lakoff, G., & Johnson, M. (1980). Metaphors We Live By. University of Chicago Press.
  → Conceptual metaphor theory: Abstract thought is fundamentally metaphorical, grounded in
     bodily experience. Supports symbolic consciousness as fundamental to cognition.

**Mindfulness and Depth**:
- Creswell, J. D. (2017). Mindfulness interventions. Annual Review of Psychology, 68, 491-516.
  → Mindfulness (observing inner experience non-judgmentally) shows clinical benefits. Western
     parallel to Jungian attention to psychic contents.

**Emotional Suppression Costs**:
- Gross, J. J., & John, O. P. (2003). Individual differences in two emotion regulation processes.
  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85(2), 348-362.
  → Chronic emotion suppression associated with reduced well-being, impaired relationships.
     Supports Psychism's critique of emotional repression.
