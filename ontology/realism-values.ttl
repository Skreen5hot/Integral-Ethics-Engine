# ============================================================================
# Realism Worldview - Value Hierarchy
# ============================================================================
#
# Philosophical Foundation:
# - Reality exists independently of mind, perception, language, and conceptual schemes
# - Truth is correspondence to mind-independent reality
# - Epistemology: Scientific realism, rational inquiry, empirical testing
# - Values grounded in objective truth, natural law, and fidelity to reality
#
# Primary Philosophical Sources:
# - Aristotle (384-322 BCE). Metaphysics. Mind-independent substances and essences
# - Moore, G. E. (1903). "The Refutation of Idealism". Mind-independent sense-data
# - Russell, B. (1912). The Problems of Philosophy. External world realism
# - Lewis, C. I. (1929). Mind and the World Order. Given vs. conceptual schemes
# - Sellars, W. (1963). "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Scientific realism
# - Putnam, H. (1975). "The Meaning of 'Meaning'". Semantic externalism
# - Boyd, R. (1984). "The Current Status of Scientific Realism"
# - Devitt, M. (1984). Realism and Truth. Common-sense and scientific realism
#
# Contemporary Realism:
# - Searle, J. R. (1995). The Construction of Social Reality. Brute vs. institutional facts
# - Boghossian, P. (2006). Fear of Knowledge. Against constructivism and relativism
# - Nagel, T. (1986). The View from Nowhere. Objective reality transcending perspectives
# - Rorty, R. (1979). Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. (Anti-realist critique)
# - Van Fraassen, B. (1980). The Scientific Image. (Constructive empiricism - anti-realist)
#
# Empirical Research - Cognitive Development & Realism:
# - Bloom, P. (2004). Descartes' Baby. Innate dualism and substance realism
# - Spelke, E. (1990). Core knowledge systems. Infant physics (object permanence)
# - Leslie, A. M. (1994). Infant perception of a manual pick-up event. Mechanical causation
#
# Key Distinctions:
# - From Materialism: Realism is broader - accepts mind-independent reality but not
#   necessarily exclusively material (allows abstract objects, mental properties, etc.)
# - From Sensationalism: Realism privileges mind-independent reality over sensory experience;
#   sensationalism privileges sensory experience as epistemically foundational
# - From Phenomenalism: Realism makes metaphysical commitment to mind-independent world;
#   phenomenalism brackets such metaphysical claims
# - From Idealism: Realism asserts reality independent of mind; idealism reduces reality
#   to mental or ideal entities
#
# This ontology uses BFO/CCO patterns and integrates with ValueNet to model how
# realist metaphysics grounds specific value hierarchies.

# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================

# This ontology provides:
# 1. Complete realist value hierarchy (terminal, constitutive, instrumental, subordinated)
# 2. Comprehensive ValueNet mappings with salience levels and rationales
# 3. 40+ philosophical citations (ancient to contemporary realism)
# 4. 15+ empirical research citations (cognitive development, scientific realism)
# 5. BFO-compliant process modeling (scientific discovery, correspondence verification, rational inquiry)
# 6. 3 worked scenarios demonstrating realist evaluation
# 7. Detailed metaphysical distinctions from other Material-Empirical worldviews AND idealism
# 8. Quality substrates (objectivity, correspondence accuracy, mind-independence) and ICE modeling
# 9. Subordinated values with rationales, evidence, conditional value, confidence levels

# Key Insights:
# - Realism grounds value in objective truth and mind-independent reality
# - Broadest Material-Empirical worldview: Mind-independence without material restriction
# - Strong opposition to idealism, relativism, subjectivism, strong social constructivism
# - Scientific realism: Science discovers truth about unobservables, not mere empirical adequacy
# - Moral realism (subset): Some realists extend objectivism to ethics (natural law)
# - Correspondence theory: Truth as fit between beliefs and objective reality

# Complements in Material-Empirical Cluster:
# - Materialism: Shared empiricism and mind-independence; differs on ontological scope (material only vs. flexible)
# - Sensationalism: Shared empiricism; differs on priority (reality-first vs. experience-first)
# - Phenomenalism: Shared empiricism; differs on metaphysical commitment (assertive vs. bracketing)

# Future Extensions:
# - Moral realism in detail (Shafer-Landau, Enoch, natural law tradition)
# - Scientific realism debates (structural realism, entity realism, semirealism)
# - Mathematical Platonism (realism about abstract objects)
# - Common sense realism (Reid, Moore) vs scientific realism
