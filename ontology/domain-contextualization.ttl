# Domain Contextualization Ontology - BFO 2020 Compliant
# ============================================================================
#
# Purpose: Models how different life domains appropriately weight worldview
# relevance to prevent absurd applications while respecting worldview plurality.
#
# Philosophical Foundation:
# This ontology addresses the critical insight that not all worldviews are
# equally appropriate in all contexts. Domain-specific contextualization
# prevents:
# 1. Absurd applications (e.g., spiritualism dominating surgery technique)
# 2. Hidden elimination of worldviews (domain weighting ≠ universal rejection)
# 3. Context-blind moral reasoning (different domains have different purposes)
# 4. False universalism (pretending all contexts are equivalent)
#
# Key Philosophical Sources:
# - Gould, S. J. (1997). Non-Overlapping Magisteria (NOMA): Science and religion
#   address different domains with different methods and purposes.
# - Walzer, M. (1983). Spheres of Justice: Different goods distributed by
#   different principles in different spheres (health, education, love, etc.)
# - MacIntyre, A. (1981). After Virtue: Social practices have internal goods
#   that determine appropriate virtues and standards.
# - Habermas, J. (1984). Theory of Communicative Action: Different action types
#   (instrumental, strategic, communicative) appropriate in different domains.
#
# Empirical Foundation:
# - Hedlund-de Witt, A. (2012). Exploring worldviews and their relationships
#   to sustainable lifestyles: Domain-appropriate worldviews predict behavior.
# - Tetlock, P. E. (2003). Thinking the unthinkable: Sacred values and taboo
#   cognitions. Domain violations trigger moral outrage.
# - Fiske, A. P., & Tetlock, P. E. (1997). Taboo trade-offs: Reactions to
#   transactions that transgress spheres of justice.

#   variation (personal vs. conventional vs. universal domains).

# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================

# This ontology provides:
# 1. BFO-compliant modeling of domains as ICE with worldview weight profiles
# 2. Eight major life domains with comprehensive worldview weightings (0.0-1.0 scale)
# 3. Rationale and empirical evidence for each worldview weight in each domain
# 4. Integration with value-conflict-resolution.ttl (Step 4 contextualization)
# 5. Domain boundary dispute recognition and resolution strategies
# 6. 40+ philosophical and empirical sources
# 7. Critical notes explaining weight rationale and preventing misinterpretation

# Key domains modeled:
# - Healthcare: Materialism/Realism high (0.9), Spiritualism moderate (0.45)
# - Spiritual Formation: Spiritualism/Idealism/Pneumatism high (0.9+), Materialism low (0.3)
# - Education: Idealism/Rationalism/Dynamism high (0.85+), balanced objective/subjective
# - Vocational Choice: Monadism very high (0.95), authenticity paramount
# - Environmental Policy: Pneumatism/Materialism/Rationalism high (0.8+), unique integration
# - Relationship Ethics: Monadism/Psychism very high (0.9+), rationalism low (0.35)
# - Business/Economics: Materialism/Rationalism/Realism high (0.8+), instrumental focus
# - Scientific Research: Realism/Materialism very high (0.9+), spiritual minimal (0.15-0.2)

# Applications:
# - Step 4 of value conflict resolution: Apply domain weights to contextualize judgments
# - Prevent absurd applications: Spiritualism doesn't dominate surgery; materialism doesn't dominate prayer
# - Make context-sensitivity transparent: Explicit weights prevent hidden biases
# - Enable appropriate weighting without elimination: Low weight ≠ false or worthless

# Critical principles:
# - Domain weights reflect PURPOSE-APPROPRIATENESS, not universal truth claims
# - Low weight in one domain doesn't negate high weight in another domain
# - Weights are guidelines requiring judgment in application, not mechanical rules
# - Domain boundary disputes are common and require contextual wisdom
# - Multi-domain situations require integration of multiple weight profiles

# Future extensions:
# - Additional domains (artistic creation, political deliberation, contemplative practice)
# - Empirical validation of weight profiles through expert surveys
# - Computational retrieval of domain weights for automated moral reasoning
# - Cultural variation in domain weight profiles (cross-cultural studies)
# - Temporal changes in domain norms (historical evolution of domain boundaries)
