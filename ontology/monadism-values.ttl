# MONADISM WORLDVIEW VALUE ONTOLOGY
# ============================================================================
#
# Worldview: Monadism (Personalism, Individual Uniqueness)
# Foundation: Individual Monad - Each person is irreducibly unique
# Primacy: Personal dignity, authentic individuality, irreplaceable perspectives
# Epistemology: First-person authority, phenomenological access to unique interiority
# Cluster: Process-Individual
#
# Key Thinkers:
# - Leibniz (1646-1716): Monadology - windowless monads, pre-established harmony
# - Max Scheler (1874-1928): Formalism in Ethics - person as irreducible value-center
# - Emmanuel Mounier (1905-1950): Personalism - person vs. individual
# - Martin Buber (1878-1965): I and Thou - irreducible relation between persons
# - Karol Wojtyła (1920-2005): The Acting Person - subjectivity and self-determination

From Monadism perspective:
- Terminal value PersonalDignity: Each person has intrinsic worth, not reducible to numbers. One person is not worth less than five.
- Anti-utilitarianism: Cannot treat person as mere means even for greater good. Instrumentalization violates dignity.
- Irreplaceable uniqueness: Each of the six persons is irreplaceable. Cannot substitute or aggregate.
- Non-aggregative: Five lives don't 'outweigh' one life - persons don't aggregate like quantities. Each life is infinity (Levinas).
- Respect for persons: Killing one treats them as expendable resource, violates their dignity as end-in-themselves.
- First-person perspective: From perspective of the one, being sacrificed for utility is absolute violation.
- Verdict: Cannot kill one to save five - violates non-instrumentalization. Monadism rejects utilitarian mathematics of persons.
- Nuance: Difference between killing (active violation) and letting die (tragic but not instrumentalizing).
- Deontological affinity: Monadism aligns with Kantian deontology - persons are ends, never mere means.

- Family obligations: Real but must be negotiated with autonomy. Cannot require self-betrayal.
- Instrumental value SelfActualization: Pursuing authentic calling is means to realizing unique potential.
- Risk: Authentic path may be difficult, uncertain. But Monadism says authentic struggle better than inauthentic comfort.
- Verdict: Person should pursue authentic calling. Cannot live parent's vision of good life - must discover own.

- Autonomous agency: Person has right to determine what they will/won't do. Coerced or guilted help violates autonomy.
- Authentic boundaries: True self has limits. Violating them causes self-fragmentation, inauthenticity.
- Personalist care: True care respects both persons as irreplaceable individuals with dignity. Doesn't require self-sacrifice that destroys helper's integrity.
- Verdict: Person should maintain authentic boundaries even when helping others. Can help in ways aligned with own values and capacities.
