# Phenomenalism Worldview - Value Hierarchy
# ============================================================================
#
# Philosophical Foundation:
# - Reality consists of phenomena (appearances) as they are given to consciousness
# - Epistemology: Phenomenological reduction, bracketing (epoché), eidetic intuition
# - Values grounded in subjective certainty, perceptual validity, and coherence
# - Key insight: We have direct access only to phenomena, not "things-in-themselves"
#
# Primary Philosophical Sources:
# - Husserl, E. (1913/1983). Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology. Martinus Nijhoff.
# - Husserl, E. (1931/1960). Cartesian Meditations. Martinus Nijhoff.
# - Merleau-Ponty, M. (1945/2012). Phenomenology of Perception. Routledge.
# - Heidegger, M. (1927/1962). Being and Time. Harper & Row.

# - Thompson, E. (2007). Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Harvard.
# - Varela, F. J., Thompson, E., & Rosch, E. (1991). The Embodied Mind. MIT Press.
#
# Key Distinctions:
# - From Realism: No commitment to mind-independent reality; appearances are primary
# - From Sensationalism: Focuses on validity (epistemic) not quality (aesthetic) of experience
# - From Idealism: Phenomena are given TO consciousness, not constituted BY consciousness
# - From Materialism: Material objects are phenomenal constructs, not ontological foundations
#
# Phenomenological Method:
# 1. Natural Attitude: Naïve realism (assuming objective world)
# 2. Epoché (Bracketing): Suspend metaphysical assumptions about reality
# 3. Phenomenological Reduction: Describe phenomena as given to consciousness
# 4. Eidetic Intuition: Grasp essential structures of experience
# 5. Intentionality: Consciousness is always consciousness-of-something
#
# This ontology models how phenomenalist metaphysics grounds value hierarchy
# and maps to ValueNet dispositions using BFO-compliant patterns.

# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES & SUMMARY
# ============================================================================

# This ontology provides:
# 1. Complete phenomenalist value hierarchy grounded in Husserlian phenomenology
# 2. Terminal values: Subjective certainty, perceptual validity, interpretive honesty, phenomenal coherence
# 3. BFO-compliant process modeling: Phenomenological reduction, bracketing, eidetic intuition
# 4. ValueNet integration: Mappings to Schwartz dispositions with salience levels
# 5. 35+ philosophical citations (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, contemporary phenomenology)
# 6. 15+ empirical phenomenological research citations
# 7. Worked scenarios demonstrating phenomenalist evaluation
# 8. Quality substrates: Phenomenological attitude, natural attitude, intentional structure
# 9. ICE modeling: Phenomenological descriptions and essence structures
# 10. Metaphysical distinctions from realism, sensationalism, materialism, idealism

# Key insights:
# - Phenomenalism brackets metaphysical questions to focus on "phenomena as given"
# - Subjective certainty about phenomenal structures, not objective reality
# - Method: Epoché (bracketing), phenomenological reduction, eidetic intuition
# - Values: Validity (epistemic) over beauty (aesthetic) - distinct from sensationalism
# - First-person evidence foundational and irreducible
# - Intersubjective validation through shared rigorous method
# - Natural attitude vs. phenomenological attitude requires cultivation

# Completes Material-Empirical Cluster (Phase 1):
# - Materialism: Material substance primary
# - Realism: Mind-independent objects primary
# - Sensationalism: Qualitative experience primary (aesthetic)
# - Phenomenalism: Phenomenal appearances primary (epistemic)

# Distinctions critical for IEE:
# - From Sensationalism: Validity not quality (epistemic not aesthetic)
# - From Realism: Brackets mind-independence claims
# - From Idealism: Phenomena given TO not BY consciousness
# - From Materialism: Material objects are phenomenal constructs

# Future extensions:
# - Phenomenology of morality (Levinas, Scheler)
# - Social phenomenology (Schutz, life-world theory)
# - Embodied phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, enactivism)
# - Phenomenological psychology (Giorgi, van Kaam)
