# IDEALISM VALUES ONTOLOGY
# Process-Individual Worldview Cluster
# ====================================================================
# This ontology defines the value hierarchy for the Idealism worldview,
# which grounds reality in consciousness, ideas, and mental phenomena.
# Idealism holds that mind or spirit is the fundamental substance of
# reality, and material phenomena are derivative or dependent on mind.
#
# Key philosophical traditions:
# - Platonic Idealism: Ideas/Forms as ultimate reality
# - Subjective Idealism: Berkeley's esse est percipi
# - Absolute Idealism: Hegel's dialectical development of Spirit
# - Transcendental Idealism: Kant's conditions of possible experience
# - German Idealism: Fichte, Schelling, systematic philosophy
#
# Size target: 40-50KB
# BFO compliance: Process modeling for consciousness development,
#                 ICE entities for ideas, Quality substrates for mental clarity

    skos:definition "A neuroscientist claims: 'We've now proven that consciousness is just neurons firing - it's completely reducible to brain chemistry.' How does Idealism evaluate this claim?"@en ;

    :analysis """
Idealist Analysis:

1. METAPHYSICAL CRITIQUE (Ideas as Causal):
   - The neuroscientist's claim presupposes materialist metaphysics
   - Commits category mistake: attempts to reduce the condition of experience (consciousness)
     to an object of experience (neurons)
   - Kantian response: Neurons are phenomena (appearances to consciousness), not noumena.
     You cannot explain consciousness by what appears *to* consciousness.
   - Berkelian response: We don't observe neurons directly - we observe ideas/perceptions
     *of* neurons. Reducing consciousness to neurons reduces it to... more consciousness.

2. EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRIORITY (Mental Clarity):
   - All scientific knowledge, including neuroscience, presupposes conscious observers
   - Cannot use science to eliminate consciousness - science is a mode of consciousness
   - Fichtean point: The I (consciousness) is presupposed in any claim about reality,
     including claims about the brain

3. CAUSAL EFFICACY (Ideas as Causal):
   - If consciousness were epiphenomenal (causally inert), it couldn't affect behavior
   - Yet the idea 'consciousness is reducible to neurons' affects the neuroscientist's behavior
   - This performative contradiction proves ideas/consciousness have causal power

4. PROPER RESPONSE (Consciousness Development):
   - Develop more sophisticated understanding: Neural correlates ≠ neural causes
   - Correlation between brain states and conscious states doesn't establish reduction
   - Absolute Idealism: Perhaps neurons are how universal consciousness appears
     from a third-person perspective
   - Transcendental Idealism: Neurons are empirical reality; consciousness is
     transcendental condition of any empirical reality

VALUE PRIORITY:
1. Mental Clarity (highest) - Exposing conceptual confusion in reductionist claim
2. Ideas as Causal - Demonstrating consciousness cannot be causally inert
3. Consciousness Development - Moving to more sophisticated philosophical understanding
4. Meaning Making - Providing alternative coherent interpretation of mind-brain relation

    skos:definition "A physicist says: 'Look, I can show you how matter behaves according to mathematical laws. These laws worked before humans existed. So clearly, material reality is independent of mind.' How does Idealism respond?"@en ;

    :analysis """
Idealist Analysis:

1. PLATONIC RESPONSE (Ideas as Causal):
   - The mathematical laws are abstract Forms/Ideas
   - Matter behaves according to these laws because Ideas are causally efficacious
   - The physicist has actually demonstrated that abstract Ideas (mathematical forms)
     govern material reality - confirming Idealism!
   - Forms existed eternally before particular material things instantiated them

2. KANTIAN RESPONSE (Systematic Understanding):
   - Mathematical laws describe how phenomena appear to rational consciousness
   - These are synthetic a priori truths - grounded in the structure of rational mind
   - Space, time, causality are forms of intuition/understanding, not properties
     of things-in-themselves
   - The laws 'worked before humans existed' because they are conditions of any
     possible experience, not empirical discoveries

3. HEGELIAN RESPONSE (Consciousness Development):
   - Nature is objectified Spirit - mind in its otherness
   - Physical laws are objective reason - the rational structure of reality
   - The physicist discovers mind in nature because nature *is* mind in external form
   - The development: Nature → Consciousness → Self-Conscious Spirit

4. BERKELIAN RESPONSE (Meaning Making):
   - 'Matter' is a name for stable, law-governed patterns in experience
   - These patterns existed 'before humans' as perceptions in God's mind
   - The physicist observes regularities in divine ideas, not mind-independent matter
   - Esse est percipi - to be is to be perceived (by finite or infinite mind)

VALUE PRIORITY:
1. Ideas as Causal (highest) - Mathematical Forms govern material reality
2. Systematic Understanding - Grasping the rational structure of nature
3. Consciousness Development - Recognizing mind in nature
4. Mental Clarity - Clarifying relationship between laws (ideas) and matter

    :analysis """
Idealist Analysis:

1. MEANING AS CONSTITUTIVE (Meaning Making):
   - Meaning is not 'found' as a pre-existing fact - it is constituted through interpretation
   - Consciousness actively structures experience, imposing order and significance
   - The search for meaning is itself meaning-making activity
   - Kantian lesson: Mind contributes categories and forms that make experience meaningful

2. DIALECTICAL DEVELOPMENT (Consciousness Development):
   - Hegel: Suffering and contradiction are stages in consciousness's development
   - Thesis (pre-crisis understanding) encounters antithesis (crisis) → synthesis
     (transformed understanding)
   - The crisis is not meaningless - it's a necessary moment in dialectical progression
   - Through negation and struggle, consciousness achieves higher self-understanding

3. INTERPRETIVE COHERENCE (Systematic Understanding):
   - Meaning emerges through fitting experiences into coherent narrative
   - The crisis can be integrated into life story as transformative episode
   - Bradley's coherence theory: Truth/meaning consists in systematic coherence
   - More comprehensive interpretive framework makes experience meaningful

4. LEVELS OF MEANING (Mental Clarity):
   - Distinguish levels: (a) immediate feeling of meaninglessness, (b) rational
     reconstruction of meaning, (c) ultimate metaphysical meaning
   - Absolute Idealism: Individual suffering participates in larger development of Spirit
   - Fichte: The I develops through overcoming obstacles and negations
   - Even suffering contributes to consciousness's self-realization

5. PRACTICAL RESPONSE (Education and Cultivation):
   - Engage in philosophical reflection to clarify experience
   - Study how others (philosophers, literature) have found meaning in suffering
   - Cultivate interpretive practices: journaling, therapy, philosophical dialogue
   - Meaning-making is a skill developed through practice

VALUE PRIORITY:
1. Meaning Making (highest) - Actively constituting significance through interpretation
2. Consciousness Development - Growing through crisis and contradiction
3. Systematic Understanding - Integrating experience into coherent life narrative
4. Mental Clarity - Distinguishing levels and types of meaning
5. Philosophical Reflection - Method of achieving meaning and understanding

CORE OPPOSITION:
- Materialism: Matter is fundamental, consciousness is derivative/emergent
- Idealism: Consciousness/mind is fundamental, matter is derivative/phenomenal

EXPLANATORY STRATEGY:
- Materialism: Explain consciousness in terms of physical processes

EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Materialism: Knowledge via sensory experience of material world
- Idealism: Knowledge via rational insight or intellectual intuition; experience
  is already structured by mind

VALUES:
- Materialism: Physical wellbeing, empirical verification, causal explanation
- Idealism: Consciousness development, mental clarity, ideas as causal

STRONGEST IDEALIST ARGUMENTS AGAINST MATERIALISM:
1. Hard problem of consciousness - cannot explain subjective experience from
   objective physical description
2. Knowledge argument (Frank Jackson) - knowing all physical facts doesn't give
   you conscious experience
3. Conceivability of zombies - can conceive of physical duplicate without consciousness,
   suggesting consciousness not reducible
