# Collaborations - External Team Workspaces

Dedicated workspaces for collaboration with external teams and projects.

## Active Collaborations

### TagTeam - Semantic Parser Integration
**Directory:** [tagteam/](tagteam/)
**Status:** Week 1 validation complete, fixes in progress
**Purpose:** NLP semantic role labeling for ethical scenario analysis

See [tagteam/README.md](tagteam/README.md) for detailed collaboration structure.

## Future Collaborations

This directory is designed to accommodate additional external collaborations using the same structure:
- `deliverables/` - Work products received from external team
- `requirements/` - Specifications and requirements we provide
- `communication/` - Correspondence and status updates
- `data/` - Shared data artifacts
- `dist/` - Distributable bundles
- `integration/` - Integration code and validation

## Adding New Collaborations

1. Create subdirectory: `collaborations/[team-name]/`
2. Copy structure from `tagteam/` as template
3. Add entry to this README
4. Document handoff procedures in team-specific README
