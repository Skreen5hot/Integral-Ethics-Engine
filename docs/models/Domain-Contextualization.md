# Domain Contextualization: Worldview Weighting by Context

**Phase 2.5 Documentation**
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04

---

## Overview

**Domain contextualization** is the systematic process of applying domain-appropriate worldview weights in the value conflict resolution framework. The Integral Ethics Engine recognizes that different moral domains (healthcare, spiritual life, education, etc.) call for different epistemic priorities.

**Key Principle**: The **same worldview** should be weighted differently in different domains, while **no worldview** is systematically privileged across all domains.

**Philosophical Commitment**: Even with domain-specific weighting, all worldviews retain meaningful voice (≥0.25 weight) to preserve minority perspectives.

---

## The 7 Domains

The framework supports 7 distinct moral domains:

1. **Healthcare / Medical Ethics**
2. **Spiritual Formation / Religious Life**
3. **Education / Learning**
4. **Vocational / Career Choice**
5. **Environmental / Ecological**
6. **Interpersonal / Relationships**
7. **Intellectual / Scientific**

Each domain has a unique weighting profile reflecting its characteristic concerns and values.

---

## Domain 1: Healthcare / Medical Ethics

**Primary Concerns**: Physical wellbeing, empirical evidence, individual patient autonomy, minimizing suffering

**Worldview Weights**:

| Worldview | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Materialism** | 0.90 | Physical body and observable symptoms are primary |
| **Realism** | 0.90 | Objective medical facts and empirical evidence matter most |
| **Rationalism** | 0.85 | Systematic diagnosis and treatment protocols |
| **Monadism** | 0.70 | Individual patient dignity and autonomy |
| **Idealism** | 0.65 | Meaning-making in illness and healing |
| **Dynamism** | 0.60 | Healing as transformation process |
| **Phenomenalism** | 0.55 | Patient's subjective experience of symptoms |
| **Psychism** | 0.55 | Psychological dimensions of illness |
| **Sensationalism** | 0.50 | Pain and sensory symptoms |
| **Mathematism** | 0.45 | Statistical evidence and probabilities |
| **Spiritualism** | 0.40 | Spiritual dimensions of suffering |
| **Pneumatism** | 0.35 | Vitalistic healing forces |

**Justification**:
> "In healthcare contexts, empirical evidence about physical wellbeing and individual patient autonomy are weighted highly. Materialism and Realism receive high weights because medical decisions prioritize observable outcomes and patient bodily autonomy. Spiritual and vitalistic perspectives are weighted lower but still preserved for patients who find meaning in those frameworks."

**Example Scenario**: End-of-life care decision
- Materialism emphasizes: minimize suffering, respect bodily autonomy
- Spiritualism emphasizes: sacred life, divine sovereignty
- **Result**: Materialism weighted 0.90 vs Spiritualism 0.40, but both perspectives preserved

---

## Domain 2: Spiritual Formation / Religious Life

**Primary Concerns**: Transcendent relationship, meaning-making, psychological depth, sacred community

**Worldview Weights**:

| Worldview | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Spiritualism** | 0.95 | Transcendent divinity and sacred authority primary |
| **Idealism** | 0.85 | Consciousness transformation and meaning-making |
| **Psychism** | 0.85 | Depth psychology and soul integration |
| **Pneumatism** | 0.75 | Living spirit and ensouled cosmos |
| **Rationalism** | 0.60 | Systematic theology and coherent doctrine |
| **Monadism** | 0.55 | Individual spiritual path and authenticity |
| **Dynamism** | 0.50 | Spiritual growth and transformation |
| **Phenomenalism** | 0.45 | Direct mystical experience |
| **Realism** | 0.40 | Historical and textual objectivity |
| **Mathematism** | 0.40 | Sacred geometry and numerical symbolism |
| **Materialism** | 0.30 | Physical practices (fasting, pilgrimage) |
| **Sensationalism** | 0.35 | Sensory religious experience |

**Justification**:
> "In spiritual formation contexts, transcendent relationship with the divine and consciousness transformation are weighted highly. Spiritualism and Idealism receive high weights because spiritual decisions prioritize sacred meaning and psychological depth. Material and sensory perspectives are weighted lower but still preserved for embodied spiritual practices."

**Example Scenario**: Leaving organized religion for individual spiritual path
- Spiritualism emphasizes: divine authority, sacred tradition
- Monadism emphasizes: individual authenticity, personal dignity
- **Result**: Spiritualism weighted 0.95 vs Monadism 0.55, but both perspectives preserved

---

## Domain 3: Education / Learning

**Primary Concerns**: Consciousness development, systematic understanding, growth, meaning-making

**Worldview Weights**:

| Worldview | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Idealism** | 0.90 | Consciousness development and understanding |
| **Rationalism** | 0.85 | Systematic knowledge and logical coherence |
| **Dynamism** | 0.80 | Growth, transformation, and becoming |
| **Monadism** | 0.70 | Individual learning path and uniqueness |
| **Psychism** | 0.70 | Psychological development and integration |
| **Realism** | 0.65 | Objective knowledge and truth |

| **Pneumatism** | 0.50 | Creative inspiration and living knowledge |
| **Sensationalism** | 0.45 | Sensory-based learning |

**Justification**:
> "In educational contexts, consciousness development, systematic understanding, and growth processes are weighted highly. Idealism, Rationalism, and Dynamism receive high weights because educational decisions prioritize mental development and transformation. Purely sensory perspectives are weighted lower but still preserved for experiential learning."

**Example Scenario**: Choosing between vocational training and liberal arts education
- Materialism emphasizes: practical skills, economic outcomes
- Idealism emphasizes: consciousness expansion, meaning-making
- **Result**: Idealism weighted 0.90 vs Materialism 0.50, but both perspectives preserved

---

## Domain 4: Vocational / Career Choice

**Primary Concerns**: Individual uniqueness, growth, authentic calling, meaning-making

**Worldview Weights**:

| Worldview | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Monadism** | 0.90 | Individual uniqueness and irreplaceable dignity |

**Justification**:
> "In vocational contexts, individual uniqueness, growth opportunities, and meaningful work are weighted highly. Monadism, Dynamism, and Idealism receive high weights because career decisions prioritize personal authenticity and transformation. Economic and formal optimization perspectives are weighted lower but still preserved for practical considerations."

**Example Scenario**: Choosing high-paying job requiring relocation vs staying near family
- Materialism emphasizes: financial security, physical comfort
- Monadism emphasizes: individual authenticity, irreplaceable relationships
- **Result**: Monadism weighted 0.90 vs Materialism 0.70, both perspectives significant

---

## Domain 5: Environmental / Ecological

**Primary Concerns**: Ensouled cosmos, objective ecology, systematic understanding, sustainability

**Worldview Weights**:

| Worldview | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|

**Justification**:
> "In environmental contexts, ensouled nature, objective ecological science, and systematic understanding are weighted highly. Pneumatism receives highest weight because environmental decisions must account for the intrinsic value and living spirit of the natural world. Monadism is weighted lower because ecosystem concerns transcend individual organisms, but still preserved for animal rights considerations."

**Example Scenario**: Resource extraction vs wilderness conservation
- Materialism emphasizes: economic benefit, human welfare
- Pneumatism emphasizes: ensouled nature, sacred presence
- **Result**: Pneumatism weighted 0.95 vs Materialism 0.70, but both perspectives preserved

Monadism, Psychism, and Idealism receive high weights because relationship decisions prioritize irreplaceable persons and psychological depth. Mathematical optimization and material factors are weighted lower but still preserved for practical considerations."

**Example Scenario**: Marriage vs maintaining independence
- Monadism emphasizes: individual dignity, personal authenticity
- Spiritualism emphasizes: sacred covenant, divine design
- **Result**: Monadism weighted 0.90 vs Spiritualism 0.70, both perspectives significant

---

## Domain 7: Intellectual / Scientific

**Primary Concerns**: Logical coherence, objective truth, formal perfection, empirical evidence

**Worldview Weights**:

| Worldview | Weight | Rationale |

Rationalism, Realism, and Mathematism receive high weights because intellectual inquiry prioritizes rigorous reasoning and correspondence to reality. Spiritual and psychological perspectives are weighted lower but still preserved for questions of meaning and motivation."

**Example Scenario**: Publishing controversial research that could cause social harm
- Rationalism emphasizes: truth-seeking, logical analysis
- Monadism emphasizes: individual human dignity, harm prevention
- **Result**: Rationalism weighted 0.95 vs Monadism 0.55, but both perspectives preserved

---

## General Domain (No Specific Context)

**When to Use**: Scenarios that don't clearly fit one of the 7 domains, or cross-domain dilemmas

**All Worldview Weights**: 0.60 (equal)

**Justification**:
> "No specific domain context provided. All worldviews weighted equally to avoid systematic privilege."

**Effect**: Integrated judgment reflects pure weighted voting without domain bias.

---

## Cross-Domain Comparison

### Same Worldview, Different Domains

**Materialism**:
- Healthcare: 0.90 (highest)
- Environmental: 0.70 (moderate-high)
- Spiritual: 0.30 (lowest)

**Spiritualism**:
- Spiritual: 0.95 (highest)
- Environmental: 0.60 (moderate)
- Healthcare: 0.40 (lowest)

**Monadism**:
- Vocational: 0.90 (highest)
- Interpersonal: 0.90 (highest)
- Environmental: 0.40 (lowest)

**Key Insight**: No worldview dominates across all domains. Weighting varies by context.

### Domain Distinctiveness

Each domain has a unique weighting signature:

- **Healthcare**: Empirical cluster (Materialism, Realism, Rationalism) weighted highest
- **Spiritual**: Depth-spiritual cluster (Spiritualism, Idealism, Psychism) weighted highest
- **Environmental**: Pneumatism uniquely weighted highest (0.95)
- **Vocational**: Process-individual cluster (Monadism, Dynamism, Idealism) weighted highest

**Validation**: Domain weights sum to meaningful totals (5-12 total weight) and show significant variation (min-max range ≥ 0.30).

---

## Minority View Preservation

**Critical Guarantee**: Even with domain weighting, minority worldviews are NEVER eliminated.

**Mechanisms**:

1. **Minimum Weight Floor**: All worldviews ≥ 0.25 in all domains
   - Even Spiritualism in healthcare: 0.40
   - Even Materialism in spiritual: 0.30
   - Even Monadism in environmental: 0.40

2. **Explicit Acknowledgment**: Minority views section in every resolution
   - Full reasoning preserved
   - Values cited
   - Conditions for correctness articulated

3. **Transparent Justification**: Domain weighting rationale explained
   - Why majority weighted higher
   - Why minority weighted lower
   - When minority might be correct

**Example**:
In healthcare end-of-life scenario:
- Majority (permissible): Materialism (0.90) + Monadism (0.70) + Psychism (0.55) = 2.15
- Minority (impermissible): Spiritualism (0.40)
- **Result**: Permissible judgment, BUT Spiritualism fully preserved with explanation

## Domain Override

**User Control**: Users can always override domain classification or weights

**Use Cases**:
1. Scenario fits multiple domains (e.g., medical research = healthcare + intellectual)
2. User has different weighting philosophy
3. Cultural context calls for different priorities
4. Specific worldview commitment overrides domain defaults

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Custom domain weights
const customWeights = {
  Materialism: 0.50,
  Spiritualism: 0.90,
  // ... custom values
};

// Override in resolution
const resolution = valueConflictResolver.actions.resolveConflict(evaluations, {
  domain: 'healthcare',
  customWeights: customWeights  // Optional override
});
```

---

## Philosophical Justification

**Contextualism** (John Dewey):
> Moral judgment is context-dependent. The same act can be differently valued depending on the situation and domain. Domain weighting reflects this contextual sensitivity.

**Epistemic Humility** (Linda Zagzebski):
> Even with domain-specific priorities, we preserve minority views because no weighting system is infallible. Different contexts and perspectives may reveal truths we initially missed.

**Pluralism** (William James):
> Different domains illuminate different aspects of reality. Healthcare emphasizes empirical evidence; spiritual life emphasizes transcendent meaning. Both are valid in their contexts.

**Non-Reductionism** (Ken Wilber):
> Domain weighting does not reduce one worldview to another. It contextualizes their relative salience while preserving all perspectives.

---

## Testing

Domain contextualization is validated by:

- **25 domain contextualization tests** ([domain-contextualization.test.js](../unit-tests/domain-contextualization.test.js:1))
- **6 comprehensive scenario tests** demonstrating domain variety ([comprehensive-scenarios.test.js](../unit-tests/comprehensive-scenarios.test.js:1))

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Each domain has 3+ high-weighted worldviews (≥0.75)
- ✅ Same worldview has different weights across domains
- ✅ No worldview weighted at 0 in any domain
- ✅ Minority worldviews retain meaningful weight (≥0.25)
- ✅ Domain weights sum to meaningful totals (5-12)
- ✅ Each domain has unique weighting profile (variation ≥0.30)

---

## Usage Example

```javascript
import valueConflictResolver from './src/concepts/valueConflictResolver.js';
import { getDomainWeights, getDomainWeightJustification } from './src/concepts/valueConflictResolver.js';

// Get domain weights
const healthcareWeights = getDomainWeights('healthcare');
console.log('Materialism in healthcare:', healthcareWeights.Materialism); // 0.90
console.log('Spiritualism in healthcare:', healthcareWeights.Spiritualism); // 0.40

const spiritualWeights = getDomainWeights('spiritual');
console.log('Materialism in spiritual:', spiritualWeights.Materialism); // 0.30
console.log('Spiritualism in spiritual:', spiritualWeights.Spiritualism); // 0.95

// Get justification
const justification = getDomainWeightJustification('healthcare');
console.log(justification);
// "In healthcare contexts, empirical evidence about physical wellbeing..."

// Set domain for resolution
valueConflictResolver.actions.setDomain('healthcare');

// Resolve with domain-specific weights
const resolution = valueConflictResolver.actions.resolveConflict(evaluations, {
  scenarioId: 'medical-001'
});

console.log('Domain:', resolution.domain); // 'healthcare'
console.log('Weights used:', resolution.weights);
console.log('Justification:', resolution.justification); // Includes domain rationale
```
